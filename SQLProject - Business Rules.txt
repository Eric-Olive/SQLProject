Business Rules:

- Create a database for a UNCC run food delivery service similar to something like GrubHub or UberEats.
- The service will be entirely internal with students functioning as delivery drivers.
- Deliveries will be made exlusively to locations on campus to campus associates.
- Each delivery will be tied to a single person, from only one restaurant per order.
- There will be a $5 flat delivery fee.
- Total price and delivery driver will be kept track of as well as the time of delivery.
- Restaurants must be approved in order to be part of the service.
